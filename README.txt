Optimized USER.cfg for Star Citizen - July 14, 2024
Tested on Version 3.23.1-LIVE.9204897

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Move USER.cfg file to Star Citizen installation folder *\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\LIVE

2. Open USER.cfg with Notepad or any text editor, follow instructions inside to set-up file for your system and then save changes when finished.

3. Navigate to *Users\<your username>\AppData\Local\Star Citizen\sc-alpha-3.23.1_cc9wt_0

4. Delete shaders folder

5. Run game. There will be some intial stuttering as the shaders re-compile but it smooths out fairly quickly.

6. If you have some time to share feedback or results in the forums that would be greatly appreciated!

NOTE : This config was originally made for DX12 but seems to work fine with Vulkan as well.
